Basically I'm the only one contributing (invalid-email-address is just me pushing from IntelliJ)
So yeah. If you want to, go ahead and make a branch. Go crazy, I don't really care.
If you really feel like it, contact me on Discord (invite code: PuUB67vsz4) and we can talk about you becoming a developer
Other than that, there's really no need for a contributing file
